# SQL-Portfolio

This repository gives an example of my SQL Skills on the Chinook database.

There are six total examples in this repository that answer general business logic questions about the Chinook database.

The example start out with simple queries and as they progress add more joins, and sub-queries.

This is the first set of queries and other SQL techniques will be added in the future!
